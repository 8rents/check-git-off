# checkedit

> #### *Manage Git with a markdown todo list! Auto commit to a git repo by checking off todo list items. Built in node.js*

## How it works

Note: This is still in development. This is the conceptual roadmap.

### Making some todos

1. Run the application in node.js
2. Select a folder that is (or is in) a git repository
3. Adjust the project configuration like what branch to commit to
4. Create some todo list items for your project! Add in optional detailed descriptions.
5. Select a todo list item and get to work!
6. When the item is completed, check it off the list! This will commit it into git and take it off of the todo list.

### Reading the commit log

You will now have 1 item in the completed section. Checkedit will read the commit log and display commits under completed items. They will be dated and have a commit hash.
